# gps_trackme

A simple mobile application to register your gps position at a given moment in time.

The initial idea behind the application is to be able to get the GPS coordinates of your position, at a given time, so you can later know your position exactly. It can be used to know the GPS coordinates when taking a picture (if using a camera without GPS, or with GPS switched off), or to be able to remember a certain location.

Additional functionality may be to register a track and save it as a GPX track. I will explore this later.


## Usage

Nothing yet, the app is under initial development at the moment.


## Contribution

I started this project to practice with KivyMD, and also to solve a functionality that I'm missing in my phone. I'm sure there are plenty of apps out there that can track your gps, but I wanted something very simple and straight forward, and avoid any advertising.

So I'm not expecting to have a collaboration on this project. Having said that, feel free to open issues to improve the code or the functionality. If you would like to contribute, drop me a mail.
